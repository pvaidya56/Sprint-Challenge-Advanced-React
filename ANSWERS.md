- [ ] Why would you use class component over function components (removing hooks from the question)?
 To write more explicit code, leaving little work to be done "behind the scenes", allowing for better understanding of what your code is doing.
- [ ] Name three lifecycle methods and their purposes.
  
-componentDidMount() = Run code immediately after a       component is mounted.
-componentDidUpdate() = Run code immediately after a component is updated.
-componentWillUnmount() = Run code right before a component is unmounted/destroyed.
- [ ] What is the purpose of a custom hook?
To better reuse stateful logic between components and help keep our code DRY.
- [ ] Why is it important to test our apps?
 To minimize the risk of bugs showing up in production code. The tests can also act as documentation for our code.
